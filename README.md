# Onchain-dao
This project involves the creation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable a group of individuals to collectively invest in other NFT collections. The DAO operates on the Ethereum blockchain and provides a mechanism for NFT holders to propose, vote on, and execute decisions related to purchasing NFTs from an on-chain marketplace.
